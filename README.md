In this Project, I, along with my two batchmates, have worked on the Predictive modeling of the process of Catalytic Pyrolysis of Plastics. I first collected the data from Various Research papers available over the Internet and organized them in a Google Sheet. The data was Cleaned and Pre-processed for use in the predictive modeling. The dataset contained a lot of features and the target variables were the Oil and Gas yield from the pyrolysis process. Some features were dropped as there was much missing data for those columns.
After all the processing, Machine Learning Algorithms like Multi-Variate Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Random forest Regression were applied to predict the Oil yield of the process. The R2 score was highest for Linear Regression followed by Random Forest and Support Vector respectively. The accuracy of the models was not much satisfying, because of the small dataset which was available to us. We are working on Further collection of data and also more accurate pre-processing techniques to deal with missing data. Additionally, we are actively researching and implementing advanced machine-learning techniques in order to optimize the alignment of our models with the data at hand.
